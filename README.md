## Dog Walker

### User Stories

Our users are both dog walkers and those needing their dogs walked. Dog walkers are dog lovers who want to combine the joys of life with their working life--and what better combination is there than to walk dogs?! Dog owners are busy go-getters who understand that it takes a village to care for their much loved pets and they know that they can come to us to help fulfill their dog walking needs.
